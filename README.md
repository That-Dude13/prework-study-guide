# Prework Study Guide Webpage

- The motivation for the Webpage is to give other BootCamp students a resource to follow when studying.
- I built the project so that new students can a better idea of where to being their studies as opposed to going in blind. 
- It gives a succint breakdown of the major components 'HTML' 'Git' 'CSS' and 'JavaScript'
- I learn that coding bascis can be fun, and having a guide is a great tool.
