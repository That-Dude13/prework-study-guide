# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for the Webpage is to give other BootCamp students a resource to follow when studying.
- I built the project so that new students can a better idea of where to being their studies as opposed to going in blind. 
- It gives a succint breakdown of the major components 'HTML' 'Git' 'CSS' and 'JavaScript'
- I learn that coding bascis can be fun, and having a guide is a great tool.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation] N/A
- [Usage] The webpage contains notes about the backend of a webapge. Notes capture the major points of interest that a new developer should look out for and ensure they leaarn them. Also, for suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
